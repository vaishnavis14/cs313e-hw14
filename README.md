This script implements a radix sort algorithm using a custom queue class to order strings composed of lowercase letters and digits. The code defines the Queue class with essential queue operations, prepares the input for sorting, and processes the strings through multiple passes to ensure they are sorted correctly. It reads input from standard input, sorts the words, and outputs the sorted list.
